                BS/BA in Data Science & Journalism<br>
                New York University, 3.98 GPA<br>
                2020-2023<br><br>
                
                Born and brought up in Seattle, I moved across
                the country to begin my undergraduate education in New York City, the media captial 
                of the world. At the time, I was focused solely on journalism as my career path, owing
                to my amazing experiences interning with my local NPR station.
                
                Soon after I arrived at NYU, however, I discovered the joy of finding stories <b>hidden 
                in numbers</b>&#8212thus my passion for both Data Science and Journalism.<br><br>

                Now as the Editor-in-Chief of the NYU Data Science Club's publication&#8212and as a student&#8212I 
                continuously seek to expand my knowlege in the data science and storytelling worlds.<br><br>
