            <h2 class="project-title"> Figure Skating: Data Breakdown</h2>
        </a>
            <p class = "project-description">
            In this final project for my Data Journalism course, I completed a thorough analysis of the scoring system
            used by professional figure skaters. Discovering and comparing the scoring trends of male and female competitors
            led to realizations about the potential harms of the current practices in figure skating. I also utilized "Scrollytelling"
            for the first time, implementing <b>Scrollama.js, Photoshop, HTML, and CSS</b> skills successfully.

        </a>
          <p class = "project-description">
              In this article I wrote about the intersection
              of the data science and journalism fields. After conducting research, interviewing professionals, and 
              several rounds of drafting, we published this article in the NYU Data Science Club's publication. Through this
              process, I gained understanding of the tools (such as <b>Flourish, Idyll, JavaScript, and d3</b>) and resources 
              needed for practicing Data Journalism. The article has had more than 700 views and more than 90 'claps'.

          </a>
            <p class = "project-description">
              In this piece I learned and utilized <b>Datawrapper</b>. After scraping data from the U.S. News website, I used Google Sheets to 
              perform data cleaning and initial analysis. This process was important in order to find the inconsistencies, and unreliability of
              U.S. News' university rankings.

        <p class = "project-description">
            I had the opportunity to work with a National Geographic Education team to share and document my experience as a radio journalist.
          In this 7-minute-feature, I was interviewed about my time leading my high school radio station, as well as interning with the Seattle NPR
        station, KUOW. The piece is available as a part of National Geographic's "Storytelling through Audio" online course.</p>

          <h2 class="project-title">Music & Mental Health Article</h2>
      </a>
        <p class = "project-description">
        Music has been a part of my life since I was five years old, and it's difficult to overstate how impactuful the art has been on me. Motivated by my perosonal relationship
      with music, I delved into the connections between music and mental health with my final project for my written journalism course. I researched COVID-19 induced mental health trends,
    the efficacy of music therapy, and interviewed popular YouTuber Guitaro5000 and NYU Steinhardt professor Ken Aigen. </p>

        <p class = "project-description">
           Soon after schools shut down in the spring of 2020 in response to COVID-19, issues arose regarding the equity of online education for special needs students. I covered this story
          for my local NPR station, KUOW. After researching, interviewing, producing, recording, and editing, the piece was aired and published.  </p>

            This audio feature was my first full audio production. I had the opportunity to interview Mohamad Imran, a Rohingya refugee who had recently found refuge in my hometown. In creating
          this piece, I mastered the audio journalistic process, including (but not limited to) research, interviewing, professional recording process, scriptwriting, narration, and <b> Adobe Audition</b> editing.</p>
