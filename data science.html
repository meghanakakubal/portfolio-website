            <h2 class="project-title"> Figure Skating: Data Breakdown</h2>
        </a>
            <p class = "project-description">
            In this final project for my Data Journalism course, I completed a thorough analysis of the scoring system
            used by professional figure skaters. Discovering and comparing the scoring trends of male and female competitors
            led to realizations about the potential harms of the current practices in figure skating. I also utilized "Scrollytelling"
            for the first time, implementing <b>Scrollama.js, Photoshop, HTML, and CSS</b> skills successfully.

        </a>
          <p class = "project-description">
              In this article I wrote about the intersection
              of the data science and journalism fields. After conducting research, interviewing professionals, and 
              several rounds of drafting, we published this article in the NYU Data Science Club's publication. Through this
              process, I gained understanding of the tools (such as <b>Flourish, Idyll, JavaScript, and d3</b>) and resources 
              needed for practicing Data Journalism. The article has had more than 700 views and more than 90 'claps'.

          </a>
            <p class = "project-description">
              In this piece I learned and utilized <b>Datawrapper</b>. After scraping data from the U.S. News website, I used Google Sheets to 
              perform data cleaning and initial analysis. This process was important in order to find the inconsistencies, and unreliability of
              U.S. News' university rankings.
